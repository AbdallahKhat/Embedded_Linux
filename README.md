# Embedded Linux Educational Repository
Welcome! This repository focuses on learning Linux, Embedded Linux, and Modern C++ through hands-on projects and practical exploration.

---

## Purpose
This repository is a personal learning journey through:
- Linux fundamentals and administration
- BASH scripting and automation
- Modern C++ programming
- Embedded Linux system customization
- Building and deploying custom Linux images for Raspberry Pi 4 using Yocto


---

## Achievements So Far

- **Linux Administration:**
  - Gained proficiency in file system navigation, permissions, and user/group management (with visual guides).
  - Explored process management, signals, priorities, and system monitoring tools.
  - Practiced debugging and performance analysis using system calls.
- **Modern C++:** Built a user sign-up application using modern C++ features and best practices.
- **BASH Scripting:** Automated file organization and shell scripting best practices.
- **Yocto Project:**
  - Built custom Linux images for Raspberry Pi 4.
  - Created and managed custom Yocto layers and recipes (audio, infotainment, editors, graphics, and more).
  - Integrated real applications (nano, RPiPlay, scrcpy, C++ demos) into images.
- **Manual Customization:**
  - Cross-compiled toolchains, custom bootloaders, and kernels for Raspberry Pi 4.
  - Built minimal root filesystems and tested with QEMU.

## How to Explore
- Each main folder contains a README and practical exercises or projects.
- Follow the guides and scripts for step-by-step learning.
- Use the images and diagrams for visual understanding.
- Try building and running the projects on your own Linux system or Raspberry Pi 4.

## Requirements
- Linux OS (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- Basic command line knowledge
- Raspberry Pi 4 (for hardware projects) or QEMU (for emulation)
